        3 essential tips for new students at UTS
    </h2>
    <p
        style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>1. DO NOT EVER PLAY VIDEO GAMES AT SCHOOL</strong> <span text-align: left; style="font-size: 18px;"> <br>
Being a UTS student myself, I find that there are some people who use their time in class or during lunch to play video games (I, being the best student, <strong>OBVIOUSLY</strong> does NOT do that). DO NOT ever do that. You're going to miss all the important info and stuff the teacher tells you, and then you'll get a bad mark and a big X on your record. Not only that, but if the teacher sees you playing games, they're going to confiscate your device, and then you'll have to use one of the crappy chromebooks from IT for the day. And after three times of being discovered, you won't ever be able to use your device at school again, and then you need to use the terrible chromebooks for the rest of your time at UTS.</span> <br> <br>
            
        <span style= "font-size: 22px;"><strong>2. GOOD TIME MANAGEMENT IS KEY</strong> <span text-align: left; style="font-size: 18px;"> <br>
Procrastination. So amazing! Sadly, it affects us with many daily tasks. Even I, a very gifted and smart person (trust), suffer from procrastination, even now. I used to have big plans, like making a cool game, but sadly, procrastination has interfered with it all. But how do we prevent it? It's really hard. First, learn how to prioritize your tasks. The main two factors to consider while doing this are weight and time, weight being how much the assignment counts for your mark, and time being how soon it's going to happen. Next, organize your time so you can do your homework, while being able to rest. I recommend the Pomodoro technique, a thing that allows better focus, while maintaining rest. You can use it here: <a href="https://pomofocus.io/">Pomofocus</a>. This will allow for more efficient work with rest, and lets you have more time to do your hobbies or accomplish something cool.</span> <br> <br>
            
        <span style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>3. DETERMINATION, WITH KNOWLEDGE OF WHEN TO GIVE UP</strong> <span text-align: left; style="font-size: 18px;"> <br>
Yay! My favorite word! DETERMINATION (obviously an Undertale reference). But how does it help you succeed at UTS? Determination is a core trait for succeeding at UTS. Being determined means that you won't give up, even when things are hard, and this applies perfectly to work. However, while it's important not to give up, I believe that in the hardest of situations, it's okay to give up. DON'T ever spend hours and hours working on a question. At that point, even using AI is good (as long as you actually read what it's explaining; this is what I personally might do), so you don't have to spend so long on that question. Determination may be a good skill to have, but knowing when to stop is equally as essential. Another reason why determination is such a core skill is that at UTS, the workload is pretty heavy, and not only that, but the many clubs you're probably in also need a lot of work, especially if you're an exec. This equals to a TON of work. To make sure you actually finish your work, you need to organize your time effectively, like I said before, but most importantly, stay determined. Personally, my strategy is to listen to music and make sure there's no distractions, such as chats or games. Then, you can truly focus, and get everything done.</span>
